Welcome to my page! I specialize in leveraging **Artificial Intelligence**, **Deep Learning**, and **Large Language Models (LLMs)** to address critical challenges in healthcare and social impact. My expertise spans across multiple domains, including **medical imaging** where I focus on ocular vasculature segmentation using **U-Net** and **Vision Transformer (ViT)** architectures for **cardiovascular biomarker extraction**. I also work on **AI for mental health**, developing preprocessing pipelines for wearable data to predict **PTSD events**. Additionally, I have experience in **NLP & LLMs**, contributing to backend development for advanced natural language processing systems, and in **time series analysis**, where I use predictive modeling to derive insights from **passive digital phenotypes**.

Throughout my career, I have contributed to several impactful projects, such as **ocular vasculature analysis**, where I developed deep learning models for microvasculature segmentation to detect cardiovascular biomarkers, and **PTSD event prediction**, where I researched time series features from wearable data for predictive mental health analysis. I also designed a deep learning model, **EEGNet**, achieving **83% accuracy** across multi-subject datasets in **brain-computer interface** applications. My work has been recognized with several accolades, including being selected as an **Amazon ML Summer School 2022 participant**, an **IEEE Scholar**, and a **Gold Medalist and Jury Award Winner** on Research Day.
