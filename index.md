## Advancing AI for Healthcare and Social Good  
Harnessing cutting-edge AI to solve real-world challenges in health, research, and beyond.

Welcome! I specialize in leveraging **Artificial Intelligence**, **Deep Learning**, and **Large Language Models** to address critical challenges in healthcare and social impact. Explore my projects, research contributions, and professional journey as I work toward advancing innovation in AI.

### Areas of Expertise  
- **Deep Learning for Medical Imaging:** Ocular vasculature segmentation and biomarker extraction.  
- **AI for Social Good:** Passive digital phenotyping for PTSD and mental health analysis.  
- **Large Language Models (LLMs):** Backend development and applications in cutting-edge NLP systems.  
- **Time Series Analysis:** Predictive modeling for wearable device data.  

### Featured Work  
- **Ocular Vasculature Analysis**  
  Leveraging U-Net and Vision Transformer architectures for microvasculature segmentation to identify CVD biomarkers.  

- **PTSD Event Prediction**  
  Built preprocessing pipelines and identified predictive features for PTSD events using time series data from wearable devices.  

- **EEG Classification for BCI Applications**  
  Developed a deep learning strategy inspired by EEGNet, achieving 83% classification accuracy for multi-subject EEG datasets.
