    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
        I am an incoming <strong>Machine Learning Engineer</strong> at <strong>Modlee Inc.</strong>, a fast-growing startup, where I will focus on backend development and building cutting-edge large language model (LLM) and deep learning (DL) projects.
    </p>
    <p>
        Currently, I am a <strong>Research Assistant</strong> at the <strong>Big Data in Biotransport Center</strong> at the <strong>University of Southern California</strong>, where I work on ocular vasculature analysis. My research involves leveraging advanced deep learning models such as U-Net, Attention U-Net, and Vision Transformer (ViT) architectures for microvasculature segmentation and biomarker extraction. This work is directed toward identifying cardiovascular disease (CVD) biomarkers and contributing to the development of novel diagnostic tools.
    </p>
    <p>
        Previously, I worked as a <strong>Graduate Student Researcher</strong> at the <strong>Center for Artificial Intelligence in Society (CAIS)</strong> at <strong>USC</strong>. My work at CAIS focused on constructing preprocessing pipelines for parsing, structuring, and aggregating passive digital phenotypes from wearable devices. I researched and identified predictive features for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) events using time series analysis and machine learning techniques.
    </p>
    <p>
        For the upcoming semester, I will be serving as a <strong>grader</strong> for the <strong>Foundations of Data Management course (DSCI 551)</strong> at <strong>USC</strong>, assisting in evaluating coursework and providing feedback to students on core data management concepts.
    </p>
    <p>
        Before joining <strong>USC</strong>, I was a <strong>Deep Learning Researcher</strong> at the <strong>International Center for Neuromorphic Systems</strong> at <strong>Western Sydney University</strong>, where I developed a deep learning-based EEG classification strategy inspired by EEGNet. This work achieved a per-sample classification accuracy of 83%, demonstrating its effectiveness across multiple subjects in brain-computer interface applications.
    </p>
    <p>
        I am passionate about applying artificial intelligence to solve critical challenges in healthcare and for social good. My work has been recognized with multiple honors, including a <strong>Gold Medal</strong> and <strong>Jury Award</strong> on Research Day and a selection for the <strong>Amazon ML Summer School</strong>. Additionally, I have contributed to the research community with publications in reputed journals such as <strong>IEEE</strong> and remain committed to advancing AI research and technology.
