    <h1>Welcome to my page!</h1>
    <p>
        I specialize in leveraging <strong>Artificial Intelligence</strong>, <strong>Deep Learning</strong>, 
        and <strong>Large Language Models (LLMs)</strong> to address critical challenges in healthcare 
        and social impact. My expertise spans across multiple domains, including <strong>medical imaging</strong> 
        where I focus on ocular vasculature segmentation using <strong>U-Net</strong> and 
        <strong>Vision Transformer (ViT)</strong> architectures for <strong>cardiovascular biomarker extraction</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
        I also work on <strong>AI for mental health</strong>, developing preprocessing pipelines for wearable data 
        to predict <strong>PTSD events</strong>. Additionally, I have experience in <strong>NLP & LLMs</strong>, 
        contributing to backend development for advanced natural language processing systems, and in 
        <strong>time series analysis</strong>, where I use predictive modeling to derive insights from 
        <strong>passive digital phenotypes</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Throughout my career, I have contributed to several impactful projects, such as 
        <strong>ocular vasculature analysis</strong>, where I developed deep learning models for 
        microvasculature segmentation to detect cardiovascular biomarkers, and <strong>PTSD event prediction</strong>, 
        where I researched time series features from wearable data for predictive mental health analysis. 
        I also designed a deep learning model, <strong>EEGNet</strong>, achieving <strong>83% accuracy</strong> 
        across multi-subject datasets in <strong>brain-computer interface</strong> applications.
    </p>
    <p>
        My work has been recognized with several accolades, including being selected as an 
        <strong>Amazon ML Summer School 2022 participant</strong>, an <strong>IEEE Scholar</strong>, 
        and a <strong>Gold Medalist and Jury Award Winner</strong> on Research Day.
