    <h1 id="aboutme">About Me</h1>
    <p>
        I am an incoming Machine Learning Engineer Intern at <a href="https://www.modlee.ai/">Modlee Inc.</a>, a fast-growing startup, where I will focus on backend development and building cutting-edge large language model (LLM) and deep learning (DL) projects.
    </p>
    <p>
        Currently, I am a Research Assistant at the <a href="https://research.usc.edu/news/2023/07/big-data-in-biotransport-center/">Big Data in Biotransport Center</a> at the <a href="https://www.usc.edu/">University of Southern California</a>, where I work on ocular vasculature analysis. My research involves leveraging advanced deep learning models such as U-Net, Attention U-Net, and Vision Transformer (ViT) architectures for microvasculature segmentation and biomarker extraction. This work is directed toward identifying cardiovascular disease (CVD) biomarkers and contributing to the development of novel diagnostic tools.
    </p>
    <p>
        Previously, I worked as a Graduate Student Researcher at the <a href="https://cais.usc.edu/">Center for Artificial Intelligence in Society (CAIS)</a> at USC. My work at CAIS focused on constructing preprocessing pipelines for parsing, structuring, and aggregating passive digital phenotypes from wearable devices. I researched and identified predictive features for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) events using time series analysis and machine learning techniques.
    </p>
    <p>
        For the upcoming semester, I will be serving as a grader for the <a href="https://catalogue.usc.edu/preview_course_nopop.php?catoid=12&coid=209633">Foundations of Data Management course (DSCI 551)</a> at USC, assisting in evaluating coursework and providing feedback to students on core data management concepts.
    </p>
    <p>
        Before joining USC, I was a Deep Learning Researcher at the <a href="https://www.westernsydney.edu.au/icns">International Center for Neuromorphic Systems</a> at <a href="https://www.westernsydney.edu.au/">Western Sydney University</a>, where I developed a deep learning-based EEG classification strategy inspired by EEGNet. This work achieved a per-sample classification accuracy of 83%, demonstrating its effectiveness across multiple subjects in brain-computer interface applications.
    </p>
    <p>
        I am passionate about applying artificial intelligence to solve critical challenges in healthcare and for social good. My work has been recognized with multiple honors, including a Gold Medal and Jury Awards for Impactful AI/ML Research Presentations on <a href="https://srmap.edu.in/research-home/events/researchday2021/#:~:text=About%20Research%20Day,Pradesh%20on%20January%2030%2C%202021.">University Research Day 2021 & 2022</a> and a selection for the <a href="https://xathon.mettl.com/event/amazonmlsummerschool">Amazon ML Summer School 2022</a>. Additionally, I have contributed to the research community with publications in reputed journals such as <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=4275028">IEEE Transactions on Network and Service Management</a> and remain committed to advancing AI research and technology.
